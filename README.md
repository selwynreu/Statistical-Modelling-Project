# Final-Project-Statistical-Modelling-with-Python

## Project/Goals
The goal of this project is to see if we can infer any sort of trends between the number of bikes in a chosen location (Montreal) and the points of interest in said location.

## Process
Step 1: Connecting to the CityBikes API in order to retrieve the bike station name, the latitude, the longitude and the number of bikes in Montreal.

Step 2: Connecting to Foursquare API in order to retrieve information about restaurants and bars for each bike station in Montreal.

Step 3: Connecting to Yelp API in order to retrieve similar information about restaurants and bars for each bike station in Montreal.

Step 4: Joining all the data from the previous steps into a new DataFrama in order to compare the data.

Step 5: Providing a visualization used as part of the EDA process.

Step 6: Creating an SQLite database to store the collected data.

Step 7: Building a regression model to explain the relationship between number of bikes and the points of interest in Montreal and interpreting the results and findings.
